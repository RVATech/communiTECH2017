Non-profit: Richmond ARC
Our team is working on increasing web donation rates for this organization by providing a seamless user experience, from landing pages to the donation portal (powered by Network for Good). NFG offers report generation and analytics as integrations. We are making use of that to provide needed insight in to how the charity is performing and elucidate opportunities for growth. We aim to increase visiblity of Richmond Arc by highlighting campaigns managed by the org, through a redesigned website. The website will also feature booking of Arc Park facilities, which was previously only available through offline methods.

Our solution:
This website is live in production and running now. You can subscribe to ARC news, view news, schedule event, and donate money through this website. We also add donations campaigns through networkforgood and provide better data visulization solution. We also integrate the site with mailchimp. It's so much easier to do email campaigns and ads with mailchimp.
